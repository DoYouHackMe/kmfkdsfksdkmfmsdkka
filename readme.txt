if bot doesnt work try these things before dming me pls


1. extract the file
2. download node js
3. check your whitelist proper format -> ["yourid", "yourdadsid", "yourmomsid", "exampleid"]
4. if when connecting console errors and it says something about JSON undefined at position 1, try using a vpn

windows 10 without any issues so why would you have any issues wtf?
